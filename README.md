[HOW TO CONFIGURE THE BOT]

1. To change the default skin go to https://package.lobbybots.ga/skins and copy the id of the skin you want your bot to be then just change the ids(the text in the quotation marks).
2. To change the default backpack go to https://package.lobbybots.ga/backpacks and copy the id of the backpack you want your bot to have then just change the ids(the text in the quotation marks).
3. To change the default pickaxe go to https://package.lobbybots.ga/pickaxes and copy the id of the pickaxe you want your bot to have then just change the ids(the text in the quotation marks).
4. To change the default emote go to https://package.lobbybots.ga/emotes and copy the id of the emote you want your bot to emote then just change the ids(the text in the quotation marks).
5. To change the default level just change the number to what you want the bots level to be.
6. We recommend to leave this set to true so that you don't have to worry about updateing. Some updates add commands so you want to keep it to true. If you want to turn it off just replace true with false.
7. To stop the bot from adding every friend just replace true with false.
8. To stop the bot from accepting every party invite just replace true with false.
9. If you want to add your own join message remove the text in the quotation marks and replace it with whatever you would like. Note: You can use {member.display_name} to get the users display name.
